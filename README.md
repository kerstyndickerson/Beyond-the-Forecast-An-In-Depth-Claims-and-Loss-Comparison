Claims vs. Expected Losses Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes the variance between actual claims and expected loss amounts across various regions to evaluate the accuracy of risk models. It examines the Claim to Expected Loss Ratios and provides insights into regions where claims exceeded projections. The goal is to improve future loss estimates, enhance risk modeling, and ensure better financial stability.

Key Findings

Regions with High Claim to Expected Loss Ratios: Several regions showed claims significantly exceeding the expected losses, suggesting potential issues with risk model assumptions.
Sensitivity Analysis: Conducted sensitivity tests on key assumptions (claim frequency and severity trends), highlighting the importance of refining model parameters.
Data Quality & Predictive Modeling: Recommended reviewing data quality and incorporating machine learning models to improve claim forecasting accuracy.

Project Components

Excel Data Analysis: Raw data, including actual claims and expected loss amounts, visualizations, analyzed using Excel.


Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Claims-vs-Expected-Losses.git
Open the Excel file and Tableau/Power BI workbooks to interact with the data and reports.

How to Use

Open the Excel workbook to view the raw data, visualize the data, explore the findings in-depth, and perform further analysis.
Review the documentation for insights into data discrepancies and recommendations for improving risk models.

Technologies Used

Excel for data analysis, calculations, and visualizations.
Microsoft Word for generating detailed reports and insights.

Recommendations

Refine Risk Models: Based on the findings, it is recommended to adjust risk models to account for regions with high claim-to-expected loss ratios.
Enhance Predictive Analytics: Consider integrating machine learning to detect patterns and improve forecasting accuracy.
Review Data Quality: Investigate potential anomalies or missing data that could skew projections.
